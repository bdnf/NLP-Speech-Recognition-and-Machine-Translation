# Overview of projects

# HMM speech tagging

In this porject several techniques, including table lookups, n-grams, and hidden Markov models, to tag parts of speech in sentences are used, and comparison of their performance is provided.

# Machine Translation

Project focuses on building a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. 
A complete pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation. 
Several recurrent neural network architectures and compare their performance will be explored.

# Speech Recognition (Voice USed Interface)

Project demonstrates building of deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline.
Also, a comparison of several CNN1d and RNN architectures will be compared.
